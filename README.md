# klb2
Some functions for the canonical basis of a hecke algebra in sagemath, written for affine B2 but can be easily modified for other types.

Jupyter notebook should work on versions of SageMath 9.0 and above. Use at your own risk.

Code was developed in tandem with work for the article, "Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for $\tilde{B}_2$," by Karina Batistelli, Aram Bingham, and David Plaza, to appear in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.
